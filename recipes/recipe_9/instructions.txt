If you have fresh yam then peel and cut them into pieces as seen in the picture.
You may also find them in the frozen section as well at the local produce store.
Set the pan on the stove and turn it to medium heat.
Pour 4 teaspoons of oil into the pan and add one frozen packet of yam to the pan.
Close the pan with a cover and keep it closed until the yam is not defrosted.
After defrosting it, mix it well.
After 2 minutes, mix it again.
After 5 minutes, mix it well and prepare to add the following spices:
1/2 teaspoon coriander powder, 1/2 teaspoon cumin, 1/4 teaspoon salt
Mix it well and then cover the pan.
